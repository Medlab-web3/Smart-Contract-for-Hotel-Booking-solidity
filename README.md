# Smart Contract for Hotel Booking via Ethereum (2021)
This code created in 2021 in my learning phase

This guide introduces a simple Solidity-based smart contract designed for booking hotel rooms with Ethereum cryptocurrency.

## Instructions:

### 1 Access Remix IDE: Open Remix, a browser-based IDE tailored for Solidity development. Remix simplifies smart contract development, eliminating the need for terminal commands or external text editors.

### 2 Add and Compile Code: Paste your smart contract code into the Remix editor. Compile it to generate the bytecode, which is essential for deploying the contract.

### 3 Deploy to a Virtual Blockchain: After successful compilation, deploy your contract on Remix's built-in virtual blockchain. For simplicity, you can select the JavaScript VM as the blockchain environment for testing.

### 4 Interact with Your Contract: Once deployed, the smart contract appears in Remixâ€™s left panel. Here, you can interact with its functions, such as booking a room. Each interaction logs as a transaction on the virtual blockchain, simulating real-world blockchain operations.
